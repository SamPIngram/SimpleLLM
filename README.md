# SimpleLLM

SimpleLLM is a WIP basic implementation for training Large Language Models. This project will aim to include both a working module for training and generating text from created language models, as well as a series of tutorial notebooks for explaining each part of the process. The initial implmentation will be loosely based on the incredible work of the [NanoGPT project](https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT), but will be expanded to include more model architectures (e.g. selective  structured state space models) and a more modular design (multiple tokenizers and tools for running experiments).

During development I will attempt to leave [demo.py](https://github.com/SamPIngram/SimpleLLM/blob/main/demo.py) in a working state, so that you can run it to see the current state of the project.
